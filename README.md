# AI-Code-Temp
A Temporary repository to house AI code

Hello all. Sorry for the extra repository but I didn't know where to put this all.

This repository should only be here TEMPORARILY.



/* AI self scan /*

As this is quite a chunky project github has not been happy about having this all uploaded.
The main issue is that of the dataset(s). They are several gigabytes large (and so github doesn't like when I try to upload them).
Instead they can be accessed on Roboflow.com. Currently Tom Ellis as access to them and can give others access but in the short term also message me (james) and I can add others.

One other thing is that Github has altered the file structure slighty (due to empty folders). If someone is able to put the train, detect and val folders in the run folder then it should all function correctly.

TODO
- This all needs to be run on either a seperate server (with API calls set up) or on sagemaker (which ever has been decided)
- In addition some post processing will be needed to get the data in the format needed (short task)
- fix "run - train , detect, val" file structure (vv short)

This is much simpler and was ready to be uploaded a few months ago but I as far as I am aware services are now used which may require a tweak or two but nothing major
